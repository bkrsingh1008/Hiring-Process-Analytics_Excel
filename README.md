# Hiring-Process-Analytics_Excel

Project Description:
-------------------------
Our task is to analyze the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it. The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department.
As a data analyst, we'll be given a dataset containing records of previous hires. Our job is to analyze this data and answer certain questions that can help the company improve its hiring process.
The goal of this project is to use the knowledge of statistics and Excel to draw meaningful conclusions about the company's hiring process. Our insights could potentially help the company improve its hiring process and make better hiring decisions in the future.

What we can do:
-------------------------
Data Extraction:
We extract the dataset and identify the number of columns, rows, and datatypes for the business requirements.

Data Cleaning:
- Handling Missing Data: We check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to handle them.
- Clubbing Columns: If there are columns with multiple categories that can be combined, do so to simplify our analysis.
- Outlier Detection: We also check for outliers in the dataset that may skew our analysis.
- Removing Outliers: Decide on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation.
- Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing the data, summarize the findings. This could involve calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. It could also involve creating visualizations to better understand the data.

Tasks:
-------------------------
Data Analytics Tasks:
A. Hiring Analysis: The hiring process involves bringing new individuals into the organization for various roles.
Your Task: Determine the gender distribution of hires. How many males and females have been hired by the company?

B. Salary Analysis: The average salary is calculated by adding up the salaries of a group of employees and then dividing the total by the number of employees.
Your Task: What is the average salary offered by this company? Use Excel functions to calculate this.

C. Salary Distribution: Class intervals represent ranges of values, in this case, salary ranges. The class interval is the difference between the upper and lower limits of a class.
Your Task: Create class intervals for the salaries in the company. This will help you understand the salary distribution.

D. Departmental Analysis: Visualizing data through charts and plots is a crucial part of data analysis.
Your Task: Use a pie chart, bar graph, or any other suitable visualization to show the proportion of people working in different departments.

E. Position Tier Analysis: Different positions within a company often have different tiers or levels.
Your Task: Use a chart or graph to represent the different position tiers within the company. This will help you understand the distribution of positions across different tiers.
